# DGAkademi Repository

Welcome to the DGAkademi Repository! This repository contains a collection of backend projects developed using C# language, .NET Core framework, and various technologies to provide authentication, authorization, and data management. These projects were created during a course at DGPAYS and serve as examples of different functionalities and features.

## Technologies Used

- C# Language
- .NET Core Framework
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for Authentication and Authorization
- Entity Framework Core for Database Management
- Fluent Validation for Endpoint Validations

## Projects

This repository consists of 5 different backend projects, each catering to specific functionalities:

1. **W1 Car Endpoint:**
   This project provides endpoints related to car management. It likely covers operations like adding, updating, and retrieving car information.

2. **W2 Sign-up and Sign-in Endpoints:**
   This project focuses on user management, providing endpoints for user registration and authentication. JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are used for secure authentication and authorization.

3. **Basic Student Endpoints:**
   The basic student endpoints project handles student-related operations. It might include features such as adding, deleting, and retrieving student data.

4. **Homework Credit Card Endpoint:**
   This project involves managing credit card information with additional verification checks. Adding a new credit card likely requires passing through various checks to ensure data accuracy and security.

5. **Final Project Endpoints with Fluent Validations:**
   The final project endpoints project showcases more advanced functionalities, utilizing Fluent Validations for endpoint validation. JWT is once again utilized for secure access.

## Usage

To utilize the endpoints and functionalities provided by these projects, you need to have access. If you are authorized to use these features, you can make API requests to the respective project endpoints. Make sure you have the necessary authentication tokens (JWT) when making requests to protected endpoints.

Please refer to each project's specific documentation within their respective directories for detailed information on available endpoints, request and response formats, and any additional requirements.
